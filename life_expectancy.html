 <h3>Life expectancy in years is directly dependant on GDP/person , and Current Health Expenditure per person</h3>
        <ul>
            <li >
                We can now investigate each countries life expectancy and how it has changed over years
            </li>
            <li >
                For this choose a country from the drop and the life expectancy data from World Development Indicators is graphed out
            </li>
            <li >
                There are some countries that do not follow the relative linear increase because of their history. So for example Iraq , Rawanda have seen dramatic decreases in life expectancy during times of war
            </li>

            <li >
                We also see that countries like Nigeria, Libya, Ethopia have different rates of life expectancy change in different eras. <br> These can be tied back to political, social changes in the countries that led to an increase GDP and Current Health expenditure.
                This shows that Life expectancy is a lagging indicator of both of these.
